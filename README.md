### Introduction
The Visual Navigation Project aims to create a visually appealing and functional form layout with a sidebar and content area. The design utilizes a background image for the sidebar and ensures that form elements are easily accessible. The project is built with HTML, CSS, and uses flexbox for layout.

### Features
Responsive Design: Layout adjusts seamlessly on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Visual Focus: The form is centered with a background image in the sidebar, providing an aesthetically pleasing experience.

Input Validation: Form inputs highlight when invalid or focused to guide the user.

Hover Effects: Buttons change color on hover, providing interactivity.

Minimalistic Design: Focus on simplicity and user-friendliness with a clean, modern aesthetic.

###Technologies Used
HTML5: For creating the structure of the page.

CSS3: For styling and layout.

Flexbox for responsive design and element positioning.

Custom styles for form elements, buttons, and background images.

JavaScript (Optional): For form validation and interactivity (to be added).
